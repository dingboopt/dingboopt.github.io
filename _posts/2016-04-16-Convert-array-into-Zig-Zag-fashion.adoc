= Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion

Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion
Given an array of distinct elements, rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion in O(n) time. The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f.

Example: 
Input:  arr[] = {4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1}
Output: arr[] = {3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1}

Input:  arr[] =  {1, 4, 3, 2}
Output: arr[] =  {1, 4, 2, 3}

Solution1:
 first sort the array. After sorting, exclude the first element, swap the remaining elements in pairs. (i.e. keep arr[0] as it is, swap arr[1] and arr[2], swap arr[3] and arr[4], and so on). Time complexity is O(nlogn) since we need to sort the array first.
 
Solution2:
modified one pass of bubble sort: from the second item, swap if necessary. We can prove this can achieve the desired goal.
